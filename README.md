# libft

Welcome to libft! This is a project from the 42 programming school that aims to recreate some of the standard library functions in C. The goal of this project is to build a library of useful functions that can be reused in future projects.

## Getting Started

To use this library, you can simply clone the repository and compile the `libft.a` file by running the `make` command:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/hovhannisyangevorg/Libft.git
```
```bash
  cd Libft
```
```bash
  make
```
